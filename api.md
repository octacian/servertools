# ServerTools API
This documentation is also available at the official [ServerTools Wiki](http://208.69.243.45:3000/octacian/servertools/wiki). Divided into several parts, one for each main topic, this documentation includes all functions available for use from other mods.

**Note:** instead of using the prefix `servertools` when calling any of the functions or variables documented below, you may use `st.`

## Global Variables
Variables available for use within functions documented in the below sections. Note that the prefix `servertools` can be replaced with `st` as with available functions.

* `servertools` : defines modname for global functions
* `st` : points to `servertools`
* `servertools.modpath` : ServerTools Modpath for use with the dmAPI.
* `servertools.worldpath` : path of current world for use with the dmAPI.
* `servertools.datapath` : `servertools` folder within the world path for use with the dmAPI. It is recommended that you store general data within this folder rather than cluttering the root world directory.

## Data Manipulation API (dmAPI)
API for manipulating data stored within external files. Global variables are provided as mentioned above for storing files withing the `modpath`, `worldpath`, and `datapath`. It is recommended that you store unique files within the `datapath` as this prevents cluttering of the root world directory.

### initdata
**Usage:** `servertools.initdata()`

Initializes directory with in the world path in which ServerTools stores most of its data. Must be run before data can be written within the `datapath` (called within `init.lua`).

### check_file
**Usage:** `servertools.check_file(path)`

Checks the file specified through `path` returning true if it exists, and false if it does not.

### create_file
**Usage:** `servertools.create_file(path)`

Create file in location specified by `path`. Returns true if already exists, nothing if creation is successful, also printing like output to the log.

### write_file
**Usage:** `servertools.write_file(path, data, serialize)`

Write data to file. File path is specified in `path`. Data to write is specified with field `data` and supports any value including strings, booleans, and integers. The `serialize` option tells ServerTools whether or not to run `minetest.serialize` on the data before writing, and is by default set to `true` if left blank.

### load_file
**Usage:** `servertools.load_file(path, deserialize)`

Load data from file (`path`) and return through variable `data`. The `deserialize` option tells ServerTools whether or not to run `minetest.deserialize` on the data before returning, and is by default set to `true` if left blank.

### write_table
**Usage:** `servertools.write_table(path, table)`

Write table to file. File path is specified in `path`. Table to write is specified with field `table` and is designed for use with tables. The only difference between `write_table` and `write_file` is that `write_table` always serializes the data with `minetest.serialize` before writing because tables cannot be directly written to files, however, they must first be converted to strings through serialization.

### load_table
**Usage:** `servertools.load_table(path)`

Load table from file (`path`) and return through variable `table`. The only difference between `load_table` and `load_file` is that `load_table` always deserializes the data with `minetest.deserialize` to convert previously written string back to a table. 

### dofile
**Usage:** `servertools.dofile(path)`

Syntax as with the `dofile` command, the only difference being the function checks whether the file exists (using `check_file`) before running dofile to prevent errors. File specified through `path` is run as Lua, and returns `true` if successful, and `false` if unsuccessful (indicates file does not exist).

## Physical Manipulation API (pmAPI)
API for manipulated physical game objects and their properties. When the `name` field is required, provide some identification of where the function was run. Normally this would be a player username, however, when not triggered by a player the value should be as follows: `modname:callback_location`.

### clearinv
**Usage:** `servertools.clearinv(name, player)`

Clear the inventory of any `player`. Called in chatcommand `/clear` (`misc.lua`). Function requires no privileges, and triggers a detailed log.

### get_ip
**Usage:** `servertools.get_ip(name, player)`

Get the public IP address of any `player`. This function could be exploited by malicious users if improperly implemented.

### update_node
**Usage:** `servertools.update_node(name, <new_nodestring> <x> <y> <z>)`

Sets the node at coordinates to the specified item string. Do not put commas between parameters, and the new itemstring may only point to a node (not a tool or item). Entering incorrect data triggers a detailed error log. Be careful with this function, as it can destroy and place nodes without warning.
